# Philosoraptor fortunes

Philosoraptor memes in ASCII-format for use with the fortune(6) program.

Some of you may find some of these fortunes to be somewhat offensive.
Use responsibly.

Or, in the words of the Philosoraptor itself:

```

If offense is something that *you* take

                     ,,
              r-^`^wm^^wm-wmmw-^,
          .,~d ( 0)           () \
         (      .,                )
        (              ,,,,,,,,,,)
       (       ,---~~~~
       (      f        ``````````)
      (                  rw~--~mw
      |               rmY ,i^ir..
      |           ,rmw'        \ \
      )          )              \ \
     )          )           _,--x /

     then how is it *my* problem?

```

The philosoraptor.in file contains only the quotes. You may run it through
strfile(8) and install it directly.

raptor.pl is a filter which injects the ASCII-art raptor into the midst of each
fortune and centers the result. This is the default output of the Makefile.
